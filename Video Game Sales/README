# In this project I have used exploratory analysis to display general information about the video game industry as a means for a new publisher to break into the space.
# First, I used MySQL to clean the data. This involved removing duplicates and NULLs, as well as reformatting the names of platforms to allow for structured visualizations.

# Creating a staging table to maintain integrity of original data
CREATE TABLE games_staging
LIKE games_data;

INSERT games_staging
SELECT *
FROM games_data;

# Deleting Where Year was N/A
DELETE
FROM games_staging
WHERE Year_of_Release = '0';

# Searching for Duplicates
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY `Name`, Platform, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales, Critic_Score, Critic_Count, User_Score, User_Count, Developer, Rating) AS row_num
FROM games_staging;

WITH duplicate_finder AS
(
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY `Name`, Platform, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales, Critic_Score, Critic_Count, User_Score, User_Count, Developer, Rating) AS row_num
FROM games_staging
)
SELECT *
FROM duplicate_finder
WHERE row_num > 1;

# Fixing platform formatting
UPDATE games_staging
SET Platform = 'PSVita'
WHERE Platform = 'PSV';

UPDATE games_staging
SET Platform = 'Atari 2600'
WHERE Platform = '2600';

UPDATE games_staging
SET Platform = 'PS1'
WHERE Platform = 'PS';

Second, I constructed my visuals in Tableau, prioritizing displaying the top performing platforms and genres. 
Tableau file and Dashboard Screenshot can be found in this folder.
